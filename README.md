**WordPress XSS Vulnerability Assessment, Remediation & Whitepaper**

A lab-verified security assessment of two WordPress XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-1512 and CVE-2026-1404), including full exploitation proof-of-concept, attack chain analysis, and a cross-platform remediation tool. All exploitation was performed exclusively on privately owned, isolated lab equipment — no live websites were tested.

This repository demonstrates how offensive security techniques — vulnerability reproduction, payload engineering, and attack chain mapping — are applied defensively to protect real-world WordPress installations. The research establishes the actual exploitability of published CVEs rather than relying on theoretical risk assessments.

## Quick Start: wp-fix

Download the binary for your platform from [Releases](../../releases), then:

```sh
# Full pipeline: check → audit → update → verify
./wp-fix all

# Or run individual steps
./wp-fix check       # Report plugin versions, flag vulnerable ones
./wp-fix audit       # Scan Elementor data for injected XSS payloads
./wp-fix update      # Update vulnerable plugins
./wp-fix verify      # Confirm patched versions installed
```

### Platform Downloads

| Platform | Binary | Default WordPress Path |
|----------|--------|------------------------|
| Linux x86_64 | `wp-fix-linux-x86_64` | `/var/www/html` |
| FreeBSD x86_64 | `wp-fix-freebsd-x86_64` | `/usr/local/www/wordpress` |
| Windows x86_64 | `wp-fix-windows-x86_64.exe` | `C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress` |

Custom paths: `./wp-fix all --wp-path /srv/wordpress --wp-cli /usr/bin/wp`

## Why a Compiled Binary

WordPress remediation is typically done with shell scripts. Shell scripts break: quoting bugs, portability issues across bash/sh/zsh, no error types, silent failures, no test suites. A shell script that works on Ubuntu doesn't work on FreeBSD.

wp-fix is a compiled Rust binary:

- **Single file, zero dependencies** — copy to any server and run. No interpreter, no PATH issues, no "which version of bash"
- **Memory safe** — Rust's ownership system prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free, and null pointer crashes. The compiler catches bugs before deployment
- **38 unit tests** — version comparison, CSV parsing, XSS pattern detection, argument handling all verified before every build
- **Cross-platform** — one codebase compiles for Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Platform-specific defaults selected at compile time
- **Structured exit codes** — 0 (clean), 1 (vulnerabilities found), 2 (error). Suitable for cron and monitoring integration

## wp-fix Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `check` | Scan installed plugin versions against known-vulnerable database |
| `audit` | Detect XSS payloads in Elementor widget data (9 pattern types) |
| `update` | Update targeted vulnerable plugins via wp-cli or direct download |
| `update-all` | Update ALL outdated plugins (general maintenance) |
| `verify` | Confirm patched versions installed after update |
| `all` | Run full pipeline: check → audit → update → verify |
| `install-wpcli` | Download and install wp-cli if not present |

## The Whitepaper

The [full assessment](docs/whitepaper/wordpress-xss-vulnerability-assessment.md) documents:

1. **Passive discovery methodology** — how publicly visible HTML source code reveals vulnerable plugin versions to every visitor
2. **Lab reproduction** — isolated FreeBSD jail replicating the exact production software stack
3. **CVE-2026-1512 exploitation** — stored XSS in the Essential Addons Login/Register Form widget; zero-click beacon tracking and one-click credential phishing confirmed in lab
4. **CVE-2026-1404 exploitation** — reflected XSS in Ultimate Member member directory; full JavaScript execution including admin account creation
5. **Social engineering attack scenarios** — five delivery methods an attacker would use to weaponize CVE-2026-1404
6. **Full offensive attack chain** — seven phases from initial XSS to credential reuse, mailing list weaponization, device compromise, and financial fraud
7. **Risk assessment** — exploitability vs. exposure matrix
8. **Remediation** — immediate actions, monitoring, and long-term architectural options

This is a de-identified case study. The original assessment was performed for a specific organization; identifying details have been replaced with generic placeholders.

## Custom Security Analysis

We provide WordPress security assessment and remediation services:

- **Vulnerability Assessment** — Passive analysis of your WordPress installation's public attack surface, identifying outdated plugins, exposed APIs, and exploitable configurations
- **Lab-Verified Exploitation** — Isolated reproduction of vulnerabilities found on your site, confirming real-world exploitability with documented proof-of-concept
- **Automated Remediation Deployment** — wp-fix configured for your specific environment, with monitoring and cron integration
- **Managed WordPress Security** — Ongoing vulnerability monitoring, patch management, and incident response via fleet management tooling
- **Platform Migration** — Migration from WordPress to a purpose-built Rust/Axum application that structurally eliminates XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and plugin supply chain risks

Each engagement begins with a passive assessment (no testing against your live site) and scales to whatever level of remediation and management you need.
