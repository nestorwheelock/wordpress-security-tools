# CVE-2026-1404: Ultimate Member Reflected XSS

## Summary

Ultimate Member versions up to 2.11.1 contain a reflected cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability in the registration and profile form handling. User-supplied
input is reflected into HTML output without proper sanitization.

## Details

- **Plugin:** Ultimate Member
- **Affected versions:** <= 2.11.1
- **Fixed in:** 2.11.2
- **Severity:** Medium (CVSS 6.1)
- **Type:** Reflected XSS (CWE-79)

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript in a form field parameter
2. Victim clicks the link
3. The plugin reflects the parameter value into the page without encoding
4. JavaScript executes in the victim's browser context

## Affected Endpoints

- `/register/` - Registration form fields
- `/user/` - Profile display fields
- `/?um_action=edit` - Profile edit action

## Safe Demonstration

In the lab environment:

1. Navigate to `/register/`
2. In a form field, enter: `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`
3. Observe the unescaped reflection in the page source via browser devtools
4. Note: the `alert()` fires because the input is rendered as raw HTML

## Remediation

Update Ultimate Member to version 2.11.2 or later, which adds proper output
encoding via `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` on all user-controlled form values.
