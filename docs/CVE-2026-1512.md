# CVE-2026-1512: Essential Addons for Elementor Stored XSS

## Summary

Essential Addons for Elementor versions up to 6.5.9 contain a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Users with contributor role or above can inject
persistent JavaScript via widget settings that executes for all page visitors.

## Details

- **Plugin:** Essential Addons for Elementor (Lite)
- **Affected versions:** <= 6.5.9
- **Fixed in:** 6.6.0
- **Severity:** Medium (CVSS 5.4)
- **Type:** Stored XSS (CWE-79)

## Attack Vector

1. Attacker with contributor role creates/edits a post using Elementor
2. In a widget field (Info Box title, Team Member name, etc.), attacker inserts
   malicious script content
3. The widget saves the input to the database without sanitization
4. When any visitor views the page, the stored script executes

## Affected Components

- Info Box widget (title and description fields)
- Team Member widget (name and description fields)
- Any Essential Addons widget with rich text input

## Safe Demonstration

In the lab environment:

1. Log in as contributor (contributor / Contrib_Lab_2026!)
2. Create a new post, edit with Elementor
3. Add an Info Box widget
4. In the title field, enter: `<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`
5. Save as draft, then preview
6. Observe script execution in browser console
7. Note: the stored payload persists across page loads

## Remediation

Update Essential Addons for Elementor to version 6.6.0 or later, which adds
`wp_kses_post()` filtering on widget field outputs.
